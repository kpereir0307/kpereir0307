<h3 align="left">Background:</h3>
As a graduate in Public Accounting from the University of Costa Rica, I have gained extensive experience working for several multinational companies in diverse sectors, including Microchips, IoT, Direct Selling, Medical Devices, and most recently, the airline industry. Through these experiences, I have developed a strong skill set in finance, continuous improvement, and challenging the status quo.

Having worked in Costa Rica, the United States, and now Poland, I have acquired a global perspective and a desire for new challenges, which led me to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science in Poland. My insatiable curiosity and passion for innovation drive me to explore the vast potential of data science and its impact on different industries.

With this knowledge and experience, I am eager to contribute to a company that values innovation, creativity, and collaboration. I believe that my diverse background, combined with my passion for data science, positions me to make valuable contributions to any team.

Thank you for taking the time to review my profile, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your projects.
